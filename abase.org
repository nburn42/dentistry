*** Thorium
LFTR Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactors
- Thorium is very abundant
  - four times as common as Uranium (U is about as rare as silver)
  - useful Th isotope is 40,000 times as abundant as useful U isotope
  - no isotopic isolation needed - the useful isotope of Th is the only one that occurs in nature 
  - Th is present in the tailing byproduct of rare earths mining - currently waste requiring managed disposal
  - enough available on this planet to power humanity at current load for o-o-o 10,000 years
  - one mine in MI would produce enough for earth for a year as a byproduct 
- Thorium is safe
  - although officially readioactive, half-life is 14+ Billion years
  - not particularly toxic
- Molten Salt Strategy
  - Uranium can be recovered from fule/heat transfer fluid simply, since UF6 has a low boiling point, and no Th Flourate has a low boiling point
  - Molten salt heat transfer technique is much safer
    - No need to pressurize heat transfer loop
      - therefor no explosion hazard
      - leak rather results in puddle on floor, which can be cleaned after salt re-freezes
    - current practice is 70+ atm
      - Carnot (H-L)/H
    - Safety can be passive rather than active
      - Salt plug strategy
        - Plug cooled by locally powered system
        - Loss of local power ends cooling of plug
        - plug melts
        - fuel / heat transfer fluid drains
        - building can be designed so that fluid drains into containment
        - avoids need for backup generators
    - Fission products do not require fuel reprocessing (e.g., no deformation by Xenon)
    - hot fission products can be left in fuel / heat-trasfer loop to burn usefully
    - fission products that are useful can be chemically or mechanically isolated
      - e.g., Bismuth 113, useful for radiological cancer therapy
        - only grams available for use at present, but orders of magnitude more could be manufactured as byproduct
    - Leak results in a drip on floor
    - Reaction rate is homeostatic
      - increased reaction rate ->
      - increased temperatue ==
      - decreased volume ==
      - reduced reaction rate ->
      - lowered temperature ->
      - return to stable reaction rate
  - Technology is proven
    - Oak Ridge
      - Aircraft Reactor Experiement (ARE)
        - Critical 3 to 12 Nov 54 
      - Molten Salt Reactor Experiement (MSRE)
        - Critical 1 Jun 65 to Dec 69
- Ancillary
  - Other nuclear waste can be "burned"
  - Some fission products are useful
    - Rocket Fuel
    - Bismuth
- Business Cases
  - Power generation business case
    - $200 mm
    - 5 years
  - Radiomedicine business case
    - $20 mm
    - x years
    - positive reception from regulatory regime
- Other players are moving
  - nations
    - China
    - India
  -IP outside of US control
    - IP holders could enjoy "rent"
  - Pursuit of radiomedicine business
    - lower capital cost
    - friendly regulatory environment
    - profitable
    - can generate valuable IP

**** Metal Mill
**** Safety
**** Avoid getting cought by the mill
- secure long hair with a hair band
- button sleeves completely
**** Avoid getting metal shards in an eye
- wear safety goggles
**** Setup
**** Emplace work material
- Use parallels to move work surface toward or beyond upper edge of the work vise
- Tighten the work vise
- Making sure the work material to actually be worked on is within the left and right limits of the vise is safest.
**** Emplace cutting tool
- remove unneeded collet
- emplace cutting tool in needed collet
- emplace collet in mill 
**** Select speed
**** Move work material relative to cutting tool (the work material moves, not the cutting tool) :HELLO:
**** Control on Z axis (up and down)
- Located to the front, left of the machine.
- turning the handle clockwise moves the WORK up, which seems to move the cutting tool DOWN
**** Control on X axis (left and right)
- Handles located to the left and right of the work vise.
- Turning the handle on the left of the machine clockwise moves the WORK to the right, which seems to move the cutting tool to the LEFT
- Turning the handle on the right of the machine clockwise moves the WORK to the left, which seems to move the cutting tool to the RIGHT
**** Control on Y axis (forward and back)
- Located to the front of the work vise.
- turning the handle clockwise move the WORK toward the back of the mill, which seems to move the cutting tool TOWARD THE WORKER
Use cutting fluid.
Zero the X and Y axes.

** Situation
Currently, we are using one PC to control the Laser Cutter and the CNC mill. So, only one can be used at a time.  This is impacting work.  
** Status
I am stuck because the PC I am trying to install WinXP 32-bit on (the one that has been sitting on the floor in the Project Storage area) is not recognizing a USB stick as proper media.  I have changed the boot order, and temporarily disabled the HD as a boot device (since reversed), but no joy.
I have placed the set of box, keyboard, mouse, monitor, power cables, and USB stick in a corner in the laser cutter room.
The Dell Precision 490 that Slade brought has a parallel port. 
That Dell also has WinXP 64bit installed (or at least is marked as such). Since Mach3 reportedly does not run on 64bit, WinXP 32bit needs to be installed. I am working on getting a bootable USB stick with the ISO I got yesterday.
Or, we could buy a Dell Optiplex 160L on ebay for $59.08 with Free Shipping.
Slade has install CD's for WinXP 32 bit
